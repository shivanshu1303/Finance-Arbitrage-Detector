1. Fetch exchange rates using an API.

2. Convert exchange rates to graph representation with edge weights as negative logarithms of the rates.

3. Use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect negative cycles:
   - Initialize distances to all vertices as infinity except the start vertex.
   - Relax all edges up to (V-1) times where V is the number of vertices.
   - Check for negative cycles.

4. If a negative cycle is detected, display the arbitrage opportunity.

5. Build a website to display the information dynamically:
   - Backend to fetch exchange rates and perform calculations.
   - Frontend to display the results.
